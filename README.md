This program creates a profile for someone logging on to a social media. 

The prupose for writting this was so that I could learn Java so I could start working on apps.

# Development Environment

I used getters and setters to gather profile information and I used scanner to allow the user to input information

All was done with Java

# Future Work

- Get the scanner to work again. I am not sure why it broke.
- Make it flow better by adding more methods
- Figure out how to return more than one value per method
